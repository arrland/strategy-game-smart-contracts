### ResourceFarming Smart Contract Documentation

#### Overview
The [ResourceFarming](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L16) contract is designed to manage the staking and farming of resources using pirate NFTs. It allows users to stake their pirate NFTs, farm resources, and claim the resources after the farming period.

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the contract address of the deployed [ResourceFarming](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L16) contract.
- Use ethers.js v6 for interacting with the contract.
- Ensure you have the ABI of the [ResourceFarming](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L16) contract.

9. **getFarmableResourcesForPirate**
    - **Description**: Returns two arrays of resources: those that the pirate can farm and those they cannot farm yet.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `collectionAddress` (address): The address of the pirate collection.
      - `tokenId` (uint256): The ID of the pirate token.
    - **Returns**: Two arrays of ResourceInfo structs:
      - `farmable`: Array of resources the pirate can currently farm
      - `unfarmable`: Array of resources the pirate cannot farm yet
    - **ResourceInfo struct**:
      ```solidity
      struct ResourceInfo {
          string name;             // Name of the resource (e.g., "wood", "fish")
          SkillRequirement[][] requirements;  // Array of skill requirement groups
      }

      struct SkillRequirement {
          string skillName;     // Name of the skill needed
          uint256 value;       // Required skill value
          bool exactMatch;     // If true, skill must exactly match value
                              // If false, skill must be >= value
      }
      ```
    - **exactMatch Behavior**:
      - When `exactMatch = false` (most common):
        - Pirate needs skill level greater than or equal to the requirement
        - Example: `{skillName: "woodcutting", value: "1000000000000000000", exactMatch: false}`
        - Means: Woodcutting skill must be â‰¥ 1
      - When `exactMatch = true`:
        - Pirate needs skill level exactly matching the requirement
        - Example: `{skillName: "harvest", value: "2000000000000000000", exactMatch: true}`
        - Means: Harvest skill must be exactly 2, not more or less
    - **Access**: Public view.
    - **Example Usage**:
      ```javascript
      // Get farmable and unfarmable resources for a pirate
      const [farmable, unfarmable] = await resourceFarmingRules.getFarmableResourcesForPirate(
          pirateCollectionAddress,
          pirateTokenId
      );

      // Example response:
      // farmable = [
      //   {
      //     name: "coconut",
      //     requirements: []  // Empty array means no requirements
      //   },
      //   {
      //     name: "wood",
      //     requirements: [[{ skillName: "woodcutting", value: "1000000000000000000", exactMatch: false }]]
      //     // Pirate needs woodcutting >= 1
      //   }
      // ]
      // unfarmable = [
      //   {
      //     name: "sugarcane",
      //     requirements: [[{ skillName: "harvest", value: "1000000000000000000", exactMatch: false }]]
      //     // Pirate needs harvest >= 1
      //   }
      // ]
      ```
    - **Note**: Requirements are grouped in arrays where:
      - Inner arrays represent AND conditions (all requirements must be met)
      - Outer array represents OR conditions (any group of requirements can be met)
      - Empty requirements array means the resource can be farmed without any skill requirements

#### Internal Functions

1. **getResourceManagement**
   - **Description**: Retrieves the address of the `ResourceManagement` contract.
   - **Parameters**: None.
   - **Access**: Internal.
   - **Link**: [getResourceManagement](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L30)

#### Claiming with Restake

The [claimResourcePirate](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L225) function allows users to claim the resources farmed by a pirate and optionally restake the pirate with new parameters. The function accepts a [RestakeParams](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L40) struct that includes the following fields:

- [resource](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L34) (string): The name of the resource to farm. If not provided, defaults to the current resource.
- [days_count](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L36) (uint256): The number of days to farm. If not provided, defaults to the current days count.
- [useRum](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L35) (bool): Whether to use RUM for farming. If not provided, defaults to the current useRum value.
- [resourceToBurn](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L37) (string): The resource to burn. If not provided, defaults to the current resourceToBurn.
- [isSet](https://github.com/arrland/strategy-game-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/ResourceFarming.sol#L45) (bool): A flag to indicate if the struct is set. If `false`, the pirate will be unstaked.

Example usage:

```javascript
const restakeParams = {
    resource: "wood",
    days_count: 2,
    useRum: true,
    resourceToBurn: "fish",
    isSet: true
};

await resourceFarming.claimResourcePirate(collectionAddress, tokenId, restakeParams);
```

If `restakeParams.isSet` is `false`, the pirate will be unstaked after claiming the resources. If `true`, the pirate will be restaked with the provided parameters or default to the existing values if not provided.
